/*Sample Problem 2: Educational Course Hierarchy
Description: Model a course system where Course is the base class, OnlineCourse is a subclass, and PaidOnlineCourse extends OnlineCourse.
Tasks:
Define a superclass Course with attributes like courseName and duration.
Define OnlineCourse to add attributes such as platform and isRecorded.
Define PaidOnlineCourse to add fee and discount.
Goal: Demonstrate how each level of inheritance builds on the previous, adding complexity to the system. */
